# Project Intelligence File

## Project Patterns
1. Medical Data Processing
   - All patient data must be anonymized
   - PDF documents contain admission/release information
   - Google Sheets used for data entry

2. Development Patterns
   - Python backend with FastAPI
   - React frontend
   - MongoDB for data storage
   - Pipeline-based processing

3. File Organization
   - Feature-based directory structure
   - Clear separation of backend/frontend
   - Modular components

## Critical Paths
1. PDF Processing Pipeline
   ```
   PDF -> Markdown -> Anonymized -> Structured -> Database
   ```

2. Google Sheets Integration
   ```
   Sheets -> Validation -> Processing -> Database
   ```

## User Preferences
- To be discovered during development

## Known Challenges
1. Data Privacy
   - Medical data requires strict privacy controls
   - All patient information must be anonymized
   - Audit trails required for data access

2. Processing Pipeline
   - PDF formats may vary
   - Document structure preservation needed
   - Real-time processing requirements

## Tool Usage Patterns
- To be established during development

## Evolution Notes
- Initial project setup
- Memory bank established
- Architecture defined

This file will be updated as new patterns and preferences are discovered during development.
